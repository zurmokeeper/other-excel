# other-excel


other-excel is a library for working with excel. including xls reading and writing.

PSï¼šExporting xls is not supported yet

## Special Notes
Inspired by [xlsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx), some of the source code was copied directly from [xlsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx)

**The reason for all the rewrites is that the community version of xlsx is not going to be updated anymore, and also the API for xlsx is really unfriendly and costly to use, as well as the readability of the source code is not good. So use TS to rewrite it, and the API is designed and returned more friendly.**

        const workbook = await otherExcel.read('./test.xls');

        Get sheetNames:
        workbook.sheetNames -> ['Sheet1', 'Sheet2', 'Sheet3']

        Get index to get worksheet:
        const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet(0);

        Get the name of the worksheet:
        const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Sheet1');

        Get the contents of a cell in a row:
        const row = worksheet.getRow(0);  // Subscript 0 indicates row 1 

        Getting the contents of certain lines: 
        const rows = worksheet.getRows(0, 2);  // Get the contents of rows 1 through 3

        Get the contents of a cell in a col:
        const col = worksheet.getColumn(0);  // Subscript 0 indicates row 1 
        const col = worksheet.getColumn('A');  // A indicates row 1 

        Getting the contents of certain lines: 
        const cols = worksheet.getColumns(0, 2);  // Get the contents of cols 1 through 3
